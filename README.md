# GunMaster
With a team of 4 people, we managed to build a 2D platformer game in a Unity game engine in which a cop has to defeat all the robbers and save the bank from getting robbed. We have a health system in our game as well if the health of the cop becomes zero then the player will lose the game else if the player managed to defeat all the robbers then he will win the game. The game consists of 4 scenes, and the game's assets were designed by us using adobe photoshop. There following screenshots of our game are given below. Please have a look
